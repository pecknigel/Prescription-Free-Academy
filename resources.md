# Courses and Resources

This is a collection of online courses and resources that are generally recommended or mentioned in sessions. Use your own judgement with what works for you and discuss it with Nigel.

Just starting out? Towards the end you’ll find three suggested projects that you can work with to gain some experience with what web development is all about. Create a website, make an API and write a command line script.

## MDN Web Docs

The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) site features comprehensive coverage of all front-end web technologies. With HTML, CSS, JavaScript and HTTP being the main contenders.

It’s from the folks who create the Firefox web browser. Many of the links here are from MDN.

## Class Notes

Our very own “class notes” collection features summaries of important topics along with carefully chosen links to help you study.

They’re generally written in preparation for sessions with students and then shared here.

There’s not a great deal of them yet but there are enough to be useful and a lot more on the way.

## Software Pattern Library

We’re really excited about this resource. It’s the main focus of our content development at the moment.

After starting as Markdown files on GitHub Pages it’s rapidly growing to become a substantial database. Or at least on its way to becoming that.

The idea is to have a collection of building blocks for software that you can learn and use beyond the basic constructs. It’s how programming works anyway, but mostly we pick them up as we go along.

The pattern library enables you to learn and use them directly rather than coming across them by chance or figuring them out due to need.

These are not rules. They’re ideas. To build on, work with, learn from, combine and to make your own.

## Create a GitHub Pages Website

This can be great practice for working with web technologies. Jekyll is a simple and powerful system that’s easy to learn. GitHub Pages is a free and well designed system for easily using it. Improve many important skills. Not least Git itself.

## Create a Strapi Back-End API

Interested in learning to create APIs? Strapi is a great system for getting in to that. You can do everything with their admin interface (no coding) or customise everything with code to get more advanced.

This library site itself integrates Strapi with GitHub Pages to manage the Markdown for the content for the class notes and pattern collections.

It’s easy to get started. You can have an API going in less than an hour and build from there. Use it to create a back-end API for your front-end to use.

docs.strapi.io

[Strapi Developer Docs](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/intro)    
docs.strapi.io

Integrate it with a Node.js command line script to generate HTML or Markdown for your site, practice with `fetch` to query the API, or whatever else you can think of.

## Create a Node.js Command Line Script

Did you know that you can use Node.js to run JavaScript from the command line or terminal on your computer?

You wouldn’t have access to any browser APIs, but Node.js comes with its whole own set of APIs for working with the operating system.

Like file access, network access, running other programs, launching software. There’s all kinds of useful stuff that you can do.

Add any library from Node’s massive and open package library - npm - and use it from the command line to do quick tasks. Write complex scripts or even create full applications.
